--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An applications of time-varying DLNMs, specified through an interaction between cross-basis variables and the time variable, to model temporal variations in exposure-lag-response associations between heat and mortality in a multi-country multi-city (MCC) data set. Specifically, this application illustrates how to model long term variations, partly reproducing the analysis described in the article:

The code:

  * *regEngWales* stores the daily time series data from 10 locations corresponding to regions of England and Wales in the period 1993--2006
  * the numbered files from *00.prepdata.R* to *05.plots*, reproduce the results of an example with the subset of data
